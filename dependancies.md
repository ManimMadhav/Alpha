 ChatterBot is a machine-learning based conversational dialog engine build in Python which makes it possible to generate responses based on collections of known conversations.<br/>
Spacy is another module I have used, which is a NLP Python library which is used by ChatterBot.<br/>
Before you can run the code remotely, you require the ChatterBot library and other dependancies installed on your computer. Run these commands on command prompt to install the libraries:

 pip install chatterbot <br/>
 pip install chatterbot_corpus <br/>
 pip install spacy
